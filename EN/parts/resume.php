                                    <p>The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is known for its close cooperation with
                                        industry and its research drive for innovative technologies. I, too, have
                                        benefited from this and have specialized in a concept that is important today,
                                        Product Lifecycle Management and Industry 4.0, which seamlessly integrates all
                                        information along the entire product lifecycle.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Based on my goal to specialize in product lifecycle management and industry 4.0,
                                        I have mainly visited technical subjects to understand all areas of a product
                                        lifecycle. This urge has not only reinforced my technical affinity, but has also
                                        helped me to deal with overarching issues. Although the German name of the
                                        program is 'Technical Economics', I prefer the English name because it better
                                        reflects my qualifications and expertise. In addition, about 90% of my Master's
                                        programme consisted of subjects that had nothing to do with economics, but were
                                        much more technically business oriented. The enthusiasm for the engineering
                                        subjects was simply always greater. That's why I adapt the designation of my
                                        academic degree to our modern times, in which it is common to use an English job
                                        designation for job advertisements. However, this is certainly not the main
                                        reason. The Economics Engineer is well versed in both engineering and economics.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        During my time at KIT, subjects such as Virtual Engineering, Operations
                                        Research, Web Science and Production Planning and Management were the most
                                        exciting for me, as they were all about solving real-world problems on the one
                                        hand and looking to the future on the other. These subjects have also encouraged
                                        me to develop my programming skills, as our future depends heavily on
                                        programming skills. Nevertheless, special attention is also paid to the
                                        economics subjects that I completed during my studies. This gave me a heightened
                                        sensitivity in environmental economics when it came to sustainable production.
                                        Elsewhere, thanks to economics subjects, I always manage to keep an eye on the
                                        big picture and don't lose myself in detail. Topics from all subjects I have
                                        attended at KIT can be found in Product Lifecycle Management.

                                        Product lifecycle management is particularly associated with terms such as
                                        digital or virtual transformation and Industry 4.0. This is exactly where theory
                                        and practice merge. In my master thesis I created a so-called virtual Twin,
                                        which can be created generically in a virtual reality environment based on real
                                        CAD data. With this I went one step further than the digital Twin and broadened
                                        my horizons in a rather young field of research. More information about my
                                        master thesis can be found under Projects. In summary, I can say that the KIT
                                        not only trained me very well thanks to its high demands and the possibility to
                                        realize myself, but also gave me the mindset with which I make strong changes to
                                        my advantage. Now that I have completed my studies, I want to take a more
                                        in-depth look at the technical side of things and continue to deal with
                                        information technology topics such as digital transformation in order to play a
                                        decisive role in shaping our future.

                                    <p>During my studies of economics at the University of Konstanz, I focused on
                                        psychoeconomics, because even then I became aware of the important role that
                                        every form of data and market behavior will play in today's world. One of the
                                        most important components was statistics and econometrics, with which I am able
                                        to analyse large amounts of data and draw conclusions.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Already in the second semester I was fascinated by subjects like statistics and
                                        stochastics, because I immediately noticed the direct benefit. Be it in
                                        pharmacy, in the market economy or when analysing the parameters of a machine in
                                        connection with its output. Statistics accompany us everywhere and are always
                                        needed. Therefore, I saw knowledge in statistics and econometrics as a so-called
                                        hard skill with which one can solve concrete problems in the world. Other
                                        subjects, on the other hand, have usually only taught and queried superficial
                                        knowledge, which in my opinion has to be read again sooner or later anyway. In
                                        the fourth semester I then decided to specialise in psychoeconomics, which aims
                                        to explain the economic behaviour of participants on the basis of psychological
                                        theories. Fascinating insights into subjects such as cognitive and perceptual
                                        psychology were a fundamental part of this specialization, which started me to
                                        see many things from a different perspective. They not only influenced my
                                        character, but also my conceptual and analytical thinking.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        At the same time, I was able to directly link both disciplines, economics and
                                        psychology, and better understand general market behavior. Mathematical subjects
                                        such as econometrics have also contributed to this. The proof of mathematical
                                        formulas was a core component, because without the ability to derive a formula,
                                        one could collect so much data. At the end of the day, you wouldn't have known
                                        what to do with it, let alone draw significant conclusions from it. My bachelor
                                        thesis with the topic 'The influence of culture on reputation and the range of
                                        trustworthiness: online experiments in India and the USA' combined both
                                        disciplines very well. The challenge was to use game theory experiments to
                                        answer the problem and to develop market-economy alternatives for action. As
                                        already described in the title, these found game theoretical experiments in
                                        which a certain number of fictitious monetary units were roughly explained and
                                        sent back and forth between two players in several rounds. If the players
                                        cooperated with each other, the total output was always maximum, but if one
                                        player had jumped before, because he thought the other player could jump in the
                                        next turn, then his output was greater than that of the second player, but still
                                        not as high as if both players had played to the end. Based on such a game,
                                        which was implemented using Unipark and made available on an online platform, a
                                        lot of data was generated, which was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and the
                                        statistic program R. The data was then used for the analysis. To be honest, the
                                        analysis of the data was the really exciting part, because the implementation
                                        via Unipark (which I'm not a fan of yet) was quite laborious and not very
                                        user-friendly. Maybe this has changed in the meantime, but today I would
                                        approach such a project quite differently.

                                    <p>At the technical high school of the ZGK I gained a solid knowledge in the fields
                                        of product and media design, through which I am always able to combine design,
                                        functionality and user friendliness. Building on this, I have developed high
                                        quality requirements in my working method in order to do justice to both the
                                        functional design and the user perspective to an optimum extent.

                                        Actually there is not much to say about the content of my school leaving exams
                                        at the ZGK - Abi halt. Nearly everybody had to go through it sometimes and here
                                        and there also got zero points. I would much rather go into the core competence
                                        subjects. The comprehensive subject of design and media technology has opened my
                                        eyes not only in design areas, no, it has broadened my horizon. I am not a
                                        friend of drawing endless sketches and hypothetical considerations many hours
                                        before implementation. I preferred to sit in front of the computer and start
                                        with some lines and circles, for example when it came to a logo or a poster. The
                                        sketches, which were nevertheless required from the teacher as part of the task,
                                        I simply scribbled afterwards as an unattractive and unfinished version and then
                                        handed them in. Of course, I don't do that anymore in my projects nowadays,
                                        because the complexity and requirements of the result require a well-considered
                                        approach to avoid later mistakes and save time. After three years at ZGK, I was
                                        able to work with almost the entire Adobe Create Suite (now Adobe CC) and
                                        implement projects, which also benefited future employers.

                                        <br>
                                        At translake GmbH, for example, I created an entire brochure for the acquisition
                                        of the company. The topic of media design has brought me enormously forward, not
                                        least because of the harsh criticism from the then teacher in this subject. No
                                        matter how hard you tried and how much work you put into it, there was always
                                        something. At the same time, however, he also increased his own requirements in
                                        himself, because you knew that if you notice it yourself, everyone will notice
                                        it sooner or later. In summary, the ZGK has further increased my affinity for
                                        design and media and working with them through access to incredibly expensive
                                        programs and given me the ability to get into new programs in no time at all.
                                        They have so to speak greatly expanded my program portfolio, because the MS
                                        Office Suite was nothing against it....

                                    <p>In the Digital Industries Division I am currently in the international and global
                                        team of MindSphere Academy, where we train other companies and external
                                        employees in the use of the open IoT platform MindSphere from Siemens and enable
                                        them to connect machines to MindSphere, develop apps and analyze data.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You might think that moving from the Power Generation and Service Division to
                                        the Digital Industries Division was a challenge for me, but the opposite was
                                        true. After the lecture Virtual Engineering and the Virtual Reality Internship
                                        (also Virtual Engineering Internship) I once again realized where my interests
                                        and abilities lie. With the admission to the MindSphere Academy a wish came
                                        true, because I was not only able to directly contribute my technical know-how,
                                        but also to combine it with the economic aspects of my current career. As the
                                        first working student in the still relatively young MindSphere Academy there was
                                        always a flair of start-up in the air and also the tasks were not exactly
                                        pre-defined from the beginning, because one could not fully estimate the
                                        temporal capacities. This was exactly where I was able to unfold, because I
                                        quickly became a fully-fledged team member and was able to feel this by being
                                        asked for opinions and by being allowed to implement my ideas. So after a short
                                        time I accelerated the certification process by developing the simple but
                                        effective tools, the 'Material Generator' and the 'Certificate Generator', with
                                        the programming language C#. This saved a lot of time in the follow-up process
                                        of the trainings to take care of other construction sites. I am/was the support
                                        of the 'Technical Leads' and the 'Head of Operations' and was responsible for
                                        the training preparation and follow-up. As soon as I noticed that a process
                                        could be optimized, I was allowed to get to work and automate it immediately
                                        after consultation, as I achieved with the 'Password Manager', for example. It
                                        changed the passwords of all training accounts in no time at all and also saved
                                        a lot of time and work. Another big part that appreciates and promotes my
                                        experience and skills is the collaboration on the training content, which dealt
                                        with both technical and layout topics. The experience I was able to gain in the
                                        previous department came in handy for my superiors, as I was also able to use my
                                        SAP knowledge to invoice the training courses. As you can already see now, I had
                                        a very broad spectrum of tasks, which varied depending on the work situation. I
                                        didn't have any problems with that, because that was exactly what I needed - a
                                        varied field of work.

                                        The team consists of young, dynamic people who you always meet at eye level and
                                        with whom you also like to laugh before you get back to achieving your goals. I
                                        particularly liked the integration and promotion at MindSphere Academy. I wasn't
                                        just a working student, no, I felt like a full-fledged team member who could
                                        regularly attend meetings to keep up to date. I see a particular advantage in my
                                        work at MindSphere Academy in the opportunities for further training. I was able
                                        to participate in trainings and to develop my interests for the topic IoT and
                                        Industry 4.0, which I also deepened during my studies. Elsewhere, MindSphere
                                        Academy has also benefited from me, and not only in terms of processing tasks. I
                                        independently developed the so-called 'Training Tool' using Python and the QT
                                        framework, which accelerated work processes again. I programmed the creation of
                                        material for the participants, the generation of certificates and the sending of
                                        these in an individual e-mail in a comprehensive tool. You can read more about
                                        this under Projects. Even though my time at MindSphere Academy will soon end for
                                        me, I will always have positive memories of the experiences I was able to gain
                                        there and will certainly benefit from them in my future and be able to apply
                                        them in many areas. All in all, the work at MindSpehre Academy corresponded
                                        exactly to my idea of a dynamic, innovative and motivated team that promotes and
                                        challenges you in a varied way.

                                    <p>As part of the Core Developer Team, I worked on the VR Factorio project as part
                                        of a virtual engineering internship at the Institute for Information Management
                                        in Engineering. The goal was to display the computer game 'Factorio' in the
                                        virtual reality environment 'PolyVR' in real-time and to program it playable.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After attending the lecture Virtual Engineering the urge was to construct
                                        something virtual or to apply the knowledge to a project. When I had the chance
                                        to apply this knowledge in a VR (or VE) internship, I was certain, that's what I
                                        want! Although we went through an application process here due to the high rush,
                                        but in the end I could win and participate in the internship. What nobody had
                                        suspected at the beginning was how time-consuming this internship would be. Due
                                        to my technical background I was assigned to the Core Developer Team. The entire
                                        team consisted of eight people, four of whom were only responsible for modeling
                                        the game figures and other assets such as trees and stones. The Core Developer
                                        Team, on the other hand, was purely concerned with the backend. Using Python, we
                                        developed the communication between 'Factorio' and the VR interface 'PolyVR'. In
                                        addition to the communication between both programs, my tasks also included
                                        programming the camera perspectives within 'PolyVR' and the player control, as
                                        well as all input options that were later necessary for the interaction. The
                                        coolest thing about the project was that we were able to test our progress
                                        within a so-called CAVE. Simply put, this was a large black room with three
                                        white areas in a corner of the room, onto which three beamers projected a
                                        projection, so that you were in a virtual reality environment within this
                                        corner, if you wore 3D glasses. That was really an incredibly fascinating
                                        experience and has shaped me to this day! When you stand there on a white
                                        surface and suddenly a realistic 3D model builds up in front of you. You walk
                                        around, look at it from different angles and can even operate it via hardware,
                                        like a pointer - simply ingenious. This project also gave me the urge to write
                                        my master thesis at the same institute and I was even lucky to have a topic
                                        ready at that time. You can view the result of our work here on YouTube.

                                        power plants, among other things, I was responsible in the commercial area for
                                        the analysis of cost trends and the maintenance of service contracts using SAP.
                                        At the same time, this was my first step into a globally active and well-known
                                        company.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After my time at MAUS, I was initially very busy with examinations and other
                                        topics, which left me little time for applications for part-time jobs. In the
                                        medium term, however, it was clear that I would have to look for a part-time job
                                        again after an intensive examination phase. In my circle of friends, I learned
                                        about a working student position that was to become vacant, in which special
                                        emphasis was placed on SAP and Excel knowledge. Although I could not demonstrate
                                        any practical SAP knowledge, as the working environment in SAP was only shown to
                                        us in lectures, I did not see this as an obstructive problem, because in the end
                                        SAP is only a tool that is supposed to simplify the actual work. After a quick
                                        but effective training phase in SAP and all other work processes in the
                                        commercial team, my main task was to analyze and track large service projects
                                        all over the world in terms of costs so that the project goals could be met. The
                                        use of SAP and Excel was indispensable. Further activities were mainly the order
                                        settlement and cost allocation in SAP R/3 KSP and the support with the monthly
                                        project controlling. Although the team was very friendly, always courteous and
                                        helpful, unfortunately the work did not quite meet my expectations. As can be
                                        seen from the task description, the work was recursive on a monthly basis and
                                        had already been defined before I started. New challenges remained along the
                                        entire route. My original goal was to take as much knowledge and experience as
                                        possible with me, but after only a few months I realized that there was no room
                                        for manoeuvre. For example, the urge to learn more about all work processes
                                        unfortunately had to be reduced. This was also a reason why I had to answer no
                                        to the question whether I wanted to work in this department for another
                                        semester, because I had the feeling to stay on the track. In my opinion, I had
                                        exhausted all the experience that could have been gained here and had to move
                                        on.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All in all, however, I can say that it was a very exciting, almost proud feeling
                                        that gave me wings when I was given the opportunity to set foot in such a large
                                        company. Nevertheless, today I can show better SAP HANA, Excel and PMTC
                                        knowledge and like to refer to the unforgettable words of my supervisor "See it
                                        as a nice extra income and don't expect too much...". I have never regretted my
                                        decision to leave the department, otherwise I would probably never have met the
                                        team I work with today.

                                    <p>Together with other students I helped MAUS gGmbH to a rapid expansion in the
                                        entire German area within my five-month working time. At the beginning, there
                                        were places in which new training locations for first aid courses were to be
                                        established.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After my arrival in Karlsruhe and with the beginning of my studies at KIT, I
                                        soon started looking for a part-time job, not only for the sake of money, but
                                        also to further develop my skills and competences. In general, I have always
                                        worked alongside my studies, but this time I wanted to approach things
                                        differently. It shouldn't be gastronomy or anything else. I wanted to be able to
                                        combine studies and a part-time job. The work at the MAUS was very convenient
                                        for me, because I commuted a lot on the weekends between Constance and Karlsruhe
                                        and I was allowed to do the rest of my work in the home office every week except
                                        for the one to two hour team meeting, which was communicated from the beginning.
                                        All I needed was a telephone, a laptop and internet access. The opening included
                                        the analysis of urban areas, telephoning with potential landlords and quality
                                        assurance in cooperation with the local trainer. I usually preferred the
                                        listener because it was so quick, easy and uncomplicated to make contacts, to
                                        negotiate well with the landlords and to speed up the whole process. Preference
                                        was given to districts in the city centre which, however, presented a price
                                        challenge and severely restricted the scope for negotiation. I also learned to
                                        negotiate hard, as we only needed one day a week for the training sessions and
                                        conference rooms or halls were usually not needed on weekends. Also the quality
                                        assurance was a firm component of my work, because the premises had to
                                        correspond to the criteria of the MAUS and thus also the telephone calls with
                                        the landlords increased, in order to clarify the basic conditions. I was able to
                                        experience a new level of discipline at the MAUS gGmbH, because it was the first
                                        time that I (apart from my studies) worked from home. Among the locations I
                                        opened was the city of Hanau, of which I am still proud today.

                                        At translake GmbH I worked as an intern for six months and gained an in-depth
                                        understanding of project management from project planning and coordination to
                                        operations, including a stay abroad in Hungary as part of a funded EU project.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The internship at translake GmbH was not only my first internship, it was also
                                        the first time that I was fully employed for six months. Of course I had already
                                        earned a little extra money in the catering trade and other areas before, but
                                        the internship at translake should not only be an integral part of my bachelor's
                                        degree, as I quickly realized. I got to know a cool, open and equal team in
                                        which I was quickly integrated and where everyone could contribute their ideas.
                                        I simply wasn't familiar with such a way of working in my previous jobs. It was
                                        my first fundamental experience at translake. In addition, the tasks were always
                                        varied. Starting with the redesign of presentations and documentations, my area
                                        of responsibility included all supporting tasks that were currently pending in
                                        all projects. I particularly liked the joint project planning phase, in which I
                                        was also able to contribute my creativity. After a rather short familiarization
                                        phase, I also started with comparatively small projects, which nevertheless had
                                        a great benefit for the company. I was responsible for introducing and designing
                                        a new newsletter system and designed the brochure 'Successful Citizen
                                        Participation'. Click here for <a

                                            brochure.</a>. Also the maintenance of the
                                        homepage belonged to my tasks, whereby always short-term events and other more
                                        important things provided for alternation in the everyday life. Probably the
                                        most interesting project was the '2000-watt society', in which citizens were
                                        informed in a large campaign in cities around the three-country region (DACH) on
                                        Lake Constance and Liechtenstein about how they can save energy efficiently. I
                                        could tell you much more about my time at translake, but I don't want to keep
                                        this blogpost too long. With regard to my interests and goals, I can say that I
                                        have received a clear added value through my experience in project management,
                                        but that the thematic content of the projects did not fully meet my
                                        expectations, as it was more about problem definition than problem solving.
