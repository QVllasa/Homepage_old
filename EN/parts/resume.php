                                        will play. So one of the most important components was the statistics and

                                        econometrics, with which I am able to handle large amounts of data.

                                        asked, which one in my opinion anyway sooner or later again
                                        must be read. Building on this, in the fourth semester
                                        for the
                                        specialization in psychoeconomics, which aims to develop the economic

                                        decided. Thereby
                                        were fascinating insights into subjects such as cognitive and
                                        perceptual psychology
                                        a fundamental component of this specialization, which allows me to

                                        I began to see from a different angle. You have not only

                                        my character, but also to my conceptional and
                                        analytical thinking skills.

                                        At the same time, I was able to combine both areas of expertise, both
                                        to directly link economy and psychology with each other and to
                                        better understand general market behaviour. In addition have also difficult

                                        subjects such as econometrics. Proving mathematical formulas
                                        was
                                        without the ability to derive a formula,
                                        could
                                        you collect as much data as you want. In the end you wouldn't have anything to
                                        do with it.
                                        I knew that,

                                        experiments to solve the problem by means of game theoretical experiments.

                                        these found game-theoretical experiments, in which roughly
                                        stated
                                        a certain number of fictitious monetary units between two players in a

                                        and were sent back and forth between rounds. Did the players play with each
                                        other?
                                        cooperated, was
                                        the total output is always maximum, but one player has jumped off before,
                                        because
                                        thought the other player could bail on the next move, then his
                                        output
                                        bigger than that of the second player, but still not as high as the
                                        when
                                        both of them would have played to the end. Based on such a game,
                                        what
                                        implemented via Unipark and accessible on an online platform
                                        made
                                        a lot of data was generated, which can be exported using Microsoft Excel and
                                        that
                                        Statistics program R were analyzed. To be honest, the analysis was
                                        of the data
                                        the actually exciting part, because the implementation via Unipark (of which
                                        I until
                                        I'm not a fan today) was quite tedious and not very user-friendly.
                                        Maybe
                                        that's changed for the time being, but I'd be looking at such an
                                        Project whole
                                        I'd like to take a different approach.

                                        to draw endless sketches and hypothetical considerations. On
                                        dearest
                                        I sat myself down directly in front of the computer and started with some
                                        lines
                                        and circles, for example when it came to a logo or a poster. The
                                        Sketches,
                                        which were nevertheless required of the teacher as a part of the task, had been
                                        me
                                        simply scribbled in retrospect as an unattractive and unfinished version and
                                        then with
                                        was delivered. Of course I don't do that in my projects nowadays
                                        more, because
                                        the complexity and demands on the result require a well-considered
                                        Procedure to avoid later errors and save time. After

                                        years at the ZGK I was in a position to handle almost the entire

                                        created a complete brochure for the acquisition of the company. The subject
                                        that
                                        Design of media has brought me enormously forward and that not least of all
                                        by reason of
                                        the harsh criticism of the then teacher in this subject. One could
                                        no matter how
                                        and put in so much work, something always was.
                                        At the same time
                                        but he has also increased his own requirements in himself,
                                        because
                                        you knew if you'd notice it yourself, sooner or later.
                                        on.
                                        In summary, the ZGK has my affinity for design and media and the
                                        works
                                        further increased by the access to incredibly expensive programs
                                        and me
                                        the ability to familiarize myself with new programs in no time at all
                                        the way
                                        given. You have, so to speak, greatly expanded my program portfolio, because
                                        the MS
                                        Office Suite was nothing against it....

                                        <br>
                                        One might think that the change from the Power Generation and
                                        Service out
                                        to the Digital Industries Division was a challenge for me.
                                        but
                                        the opposite was true. After the Virtual Engineering lecture and the
                                        virtual
                                        Reality Internship (also Virtual Engineering Internship) was once again
                                        distinct
                                        where my interests and abilities lie. With the admission into
                                        that
                                        MindSphere Academy has thus fulfilled a wish, as here I am
                                        not only
                                        my technical know-how directly, but also to bring this directly to the
                                        with the
                                        economic aspects of my current career. As
                                        first
                                        working student in the still relatively young MindSphere Academy there was
                                        always one
                                        Flair of
                                        Start-up in the air and also the tasks were not accurate from the start
                                        predefined, since you do not fully estimate the temporal capacities
                                        could. Exactly
                                        I was able to unfold in it, because I was very quickly a full-fledged
                                        team member and I felt that too, in which I was able to find out opinions
                                        in demand
                                        and was allowed to implement my ideas. So after only a short time I was able to
                                        Time
                                        certification process by speeding up the simple, but
                                        effective tools,
                                        the 'Material Generator' and the 'Certificate Generator', with the
                                        programming language
                                        C#, which I've developed. This made it possible to use the
                                        Trainings a lot
                                        Time can be saved to take care of other construction sites. I am/was
                                        that
                                        support of the 'Technical Leads' and the 'Head of Operations' and I have been
                                        that
                                        Responsibility for training preparation and follow-up.
                                        As soon as
                                        that a process could be optimized, I was able to optimize myself and
                                        even
                                        to do the work after arrangement and automate this, as I
                                        for example with the 'Password Manager'. This has been set in
                                        twist of the wrist
                                        the passwords of all training accounts changed and also much
                                        Time and
                                        Save work. Another large part, which is based on my experience and
                                        capabilities
                                        is the collaboration on the training content, in which the participants
                                        it's about
                                        both technical and layout topics. The experience I gained in the
                                        my superiors came in handy,
                                        since I
                                        use my SAP knowledge for the invoicing of the training courses
                                        was allowed to.
                                        As you can see already now, I had a very broad
                                        The range of tasks varied according to the work situation. I had with it
                                        none
                                        problems, because that's exactly what I needed - a
                                        varied
                                        Field of activity.

                                        The team consists of young dynamic people who are always ready to help you.
                                        and with which one laughs also very gladly, before it again
                                        to the
                                        achievement of the objectives. I particularly liked the MindSphere
                                        Academy the
                                        Integration and promotion. I wasn't just the working student,
                                        no, i
                                        I felt like a fully-fledged team member who regularly attends meetings
                                        join
                                        to stay up to date continuously. A special
                                        Advantage
                                        of my work at the MindSphere Academy I see the possibilities of the
                                        Training.
                                        I was able to participate in trainings and to develop myself and my interests
                                        for the
                                        Theme IoT
                                        and industry 4.0, which I also focus on in my studies at the same time.

                                        which has accelerated work processes again. Thereby
                                        I have

                                        there
                                        always in a positive memory with me and certainly I was able to collect my

                                        one

                                        engineering. The goal was the computer game 'Factorio' in
                                        that
                                        Virtual Reality Environment 'PolyVR' in real time and playable to

                                        After attending the Virtual Engineering lecture, the urge was to
                                        also a little
                                        to construct virtually or to apply the knowledge to a project. As
                                        me
                                        then still of the possibility in a VR (or VE) practical course of this knowledge
                                        apply
                                        I've made up my mind to be able to do that, that's what I want! Although we went
                                        through here
                                        due to the
                                        a high rush for applications, but in the end I was able to win and
                                        at the
                                        I'd like to participate in an internship. What nobody had suspected at the
                                        beginning was like
                                        time-consuming
                                        this internship would be. Due to my technical background
                                        I was
                                        into the Core Developer Team. The entire team consisted of eight
                                        People,
                                        four of which only for modeling the game figures and other assets such as
                                        trees
                                        and stones were in charge. The Core Developer Team on the other hand employed
                                        clean
                                        with the backend. So we developed the communication with Python.
                                        between
                                        Factorio' and the VR interface 'PolyVR'. Besides the communication
                                        between
                                        both programs my tasks also included the programming of the
                                        Camera perspectives within 'PolyVR' and the player control, and
                                        all
                                        Input options, which were later necessary for the interaction. The
                                        coolest thing about the
                                        project was that we could measure our progress within a so-called CAVE
                                        test
                                        could. Simply explained, this was a large black room with three white
                                        areas
                                        in a corner of the room on which three beamers have projected a projection,
                                        so that
                                        you were in a virtual reality environment within this corner,
                                        provided that
                                        wearing 3D glasses. That was really an unbelievably fascinating
                                        Experience and
                                        has shaped me to this day! If you are standing there on a white surface and
                                        all of a sudden
                                        a realistic 3D model builds up in front of you. You walk around,
                                        look at it
                                        from different angles and can even be controlled via hardware, such as a
                                        Pointer,
                                        to operate - simply ingenious. Out of this project also my
                                        Ran my
                                        Master thesis at the same institute and even had the luck,
                                        that to
                                        that time also had a theme ready. You can see the result of our work

                                        responsible. At the same time, this was my first step towards a global
                                        acting and
                                        a well-known company.

                                        <br>
                                        After my time at the MAUS I was initially very involved with exams and
                                        other topics
                                        which means I don't have much time for applications to the
                                        part-time jobs
                                        stayed. In the medium term, however, it was clear that here again, after a
                                        intense
                                        The search for a part-time job is pending. I learned in the
                                        Circle of friends over
                                        a working student position that is to become vacant, in which SAP and
                                        Excel knowledge was valued. Although I couldn't get any practical
                                        SAP knowledge
                                        because the working environment in SAP is only shown to us in lectures.
                                        but
                                        I didn't see this as an obstructive problem, because in the end SAP is also just
                                        a
                                        Tool with which the actual work is to be simplified. After a
                                        fast, but effective familiarization phase with SAP and all other SAP systems
                                        work processes in the commercial team, was my main task,
                                        large
                                        Analyze service projects around the world in terms of cost
                                        and to
                                        so that the project objectives could be achieved. The
                                        contact
                                        of SAP and Excel are indispensable. Further activities were essentially the
                                        Order settlement and cost assignment in SAP R/3 KSP and the support of
                                        at
                                        monthly project controlling. Although the team was very friendly, they always
                                        obliging and helpful, but unfortunately the work wasn't quite the right one
                                        think
                                        Performances. As you can see from the task description,
                                        acted
                                        recursive work, which was already carried out before I joined the company.
                                        solid
                                        were defined. New challenges remained to be met throughout the entire
                                        stretch
                                        lie. My goal was originally to gain so much knowledge and experience
                                        to take with you
                                        as possible, but after only a few months I had to find out that
                                        in return
                                        there was no room for manoeuvre. For example, the urge had to be more over
                                        all work processes are unfortunately reduced. This
                                        was
                                        which is also a reason why, when asked if I could spend another semester
                                        in
                                        in this department with a "no" because I wanted to work in this department.
                                        sensation
                                        had to stay on track. In my opinion, I had all the
                                        experiences, which could have been gained here, and had to be
                                        thus
                                        to move on.

                                        All in all, I can still say that it was a very exciting, yes
                                        almost a proud feeling that inspired me when I saw the opportunity
                                        got
                                        to set foot in such a big business. Yet today I can
                                        better
                                        SAP HANA, Excel and PMTC knowledge and would like to refer me to the
                                        unforgettable words of my guardian "See it as a nice
                                        additional income
                                        and don't expect too much." My decision from the department
                                        resign
                                        I have never regretted, because otherwise I probably would have the team, with
                                        the
                                        me today
                                        I've never met before.

                                        soon I will also be looking for a side job, not only of the
                                        money
                                        but also for the sake of my abilities and competencies.
                                        to develop further. In general, I have always been interested in
                                        I've been working for a long time,
                                        but this time I wanted to take a different approach. There should be no
                                        Gastronomy or
                                        other. I wanted to be able to combine studies and a part-time job. The
                                        Work at
                                        the MAUS was very convenient for me, as I spent a lot of time on the weekends
                                        between the
                                        Constance and
                                        Karlsruhe and I commuted to the one to two hour team meeting
                                        weekly
                                        I was allowed to do the rest of my work in the home office.
                                        Start date
                                        was communicated. I have nothing else but a phone, a laptop
                                        and
                                        Internet access used. The opening included the analysis of
                                        urban areas, the
                                        Telephoning with potential landlords and the quality assurance in
                                        teamwork
                                        with the instructor there. I mostly preferred the listener, because one can
                                        quickly,
                                        got in contact easily and uncomplicatedly, good with the landlords
                                        bargain
                                        and accelerated the entire process. Preference was given to
                                        Districts in
                                        which, however, brought with it a price challenge and the
                                        severely limited room for manoeuvre. Here I also learned to negotiate hard.
                                        because we only need one day a week for the trainings.
                                        required and
                                        Meeting rooms or halls were usually not needed at weekends. Also the
                                        Quality assurance was an integral part of my work, because the
                                        premises
                                        had to meet the criteria of the MAUS, and so the number of
                                        phone calls
                                        with the landlords to clarify the framework conditions. I was allowed to work
                                        with the
                                        MOUSE
                                        gGmbH experienced a new level of discipline, because for me it was the first
                                        Mal,
                                        that I (apart from my studies) worked from home. To
                                        that of
                                        the city of Hanau belonged to me among other things, whereupon I was able to
                                        by the time
                                        I'm proud of today.

                                        a deep understanding of project management from the project planning stage

                                        The internship at translake GmbH wasn't just my first internship, it was also my
                                        first internship.
                                        was
                                        too
                                        the first time I've been fully employed for six months. Of course I have
                                        beforehand
                                        already in the catering trade and in other ranges a little money besides
                                        but the internship at translake should not only be more solid
                                        constituent
                                        of my bachelor's degree, as I quickly realized. I learned how to
                                        cool,
                                        know an open and equal team, in which I can be integrated quickly
                                        and
                                        where everyone could contribute their ideas. Such a way of working was very
                                        think
                                        previous jobs just not familiar. It was thus the first basic
                                        Experience I gained at translake. In addition, the tasks were
                                        all the time
                                        diversified. Started with the redesign of presentations and
                                        documentation, my area of responsibility included all supportive and
                                        Tasks that
                                        in all the projects. I especially liked the
                                        joint
                                        Project planning phase, in which I was also able to contribute my creativity.
                                        After
                                        a quite short familiarization phase it went also for me already with
                                        projects that are comparatively small, but which nevertheless offer great
                                        benefits for the
                                        that
                                        company had, let's go. I got to take responsibility for introducing and

                                        of my time at translake, but he doesn't want to send this blogpost to me either.
